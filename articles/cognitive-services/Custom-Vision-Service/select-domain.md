# Choose an appropriate domain for you project
On the project settings windows, you can select a domain for your project. Please choose a domain which is closest to your secenario. Currently there are 9 domains for image classification and 5 domains for object detection.

## Image Classification
|Domain|Purpose|
|---|---|
|__Generic__| Optimized for a broad range of image classification tasks. If none of the other domains are appropriate, or you're unsure of which domain to choose, select the Generic domain. |
|__Food__|Optimized for photographs of dishes as you would see them on a restaurant menu. If you want to classify photographs of individual fruits or vegetables, use the Food domain.|
|__Landmarks__|Optimized for recognizable landmarks, both natural and artificial. This domain works best when the landmark is clearly visible in the photograph. This domain works even if the landmark is slightly obstructed by people in front of it.|
|__Retail__|Optimized for images that are found in a shopping catalog or shopping website. If you want high precision classifying between dresses, pants, and shirts, use this domain.|
|__Compact domains__| Optimized for the constraints of real-time classification on mobile devices.|

## Object Detection

|Domain|Purpose|
|---|---|
|__General__| Optimized for a broad range of object detection tasks. If none of the other domains are appropriate, or you are unsure of which domain to choose, select the Generic domain. |
|__Logo__|Optimized for finding brand logos in images.|
|__Products on shelves__|Optimized for products on shelves.|
|__Compact domains__| Optimized for the constraints of real-time object detection on mobile devices.|

## Compact domains
The models generated by compact domains can be exported to run locally. The model performance varies depends on the selected domain. In the table below, we report the model size and inference time on Intel Desktop CPU and NVidia GPU.

|Task|Domain|Model Size|CPU inference time|GPU inference time|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Classification|General (compact)|5MB|13ms|5ms|
|Object Detection|General (compact)|45MB|35ms|5ms|
|Object Detection|General (compact) [S1]|14MB|27ms|7ms|

>[!NOTE]
>General (compact) domain for Object Detection requires special postprocessing logic. For the detail, please see an example script in the exported zip package.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>There is no guarantee that the exported models give the exactly same result as the prediction API. Slight difference in the image preprocessing logic can cause larget difference in the model outputs.
